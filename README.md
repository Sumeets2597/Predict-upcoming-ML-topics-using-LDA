# The-Hottest-Topics-in-ML-using-LDA
Machine learning has become increasingly popular over the past years.

The NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems) is one of the most prestigious yearly events in the machine learning community. At each NIPS conference, a large number of research papers are published. The number of NIPS conference papers has risen exponentially, and people are continuously looking for ways on how they can incorporate machine learning into their products and services. These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more.

We have built a LDA model to predict the most probable upcoming topics in Machine Learning Research field.
